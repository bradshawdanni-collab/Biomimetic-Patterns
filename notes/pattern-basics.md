# Pattern Basics

Biomimetic reinforcement works by:

1. **Spreading strain**  
   Patterns redirect force across the surface.

2. **Allowing glide**  
   Like fascia, they let layers shift slightly before returning to centre.

3. **Returning energy**  
   Spirals and lattices recoil gently, supporting natural movement.

4. **Preventing sharp crease failure**  
   Gold leaf fails at sharp angles — patterns protect against this.
